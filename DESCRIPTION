Description: Routines in 'qtl2' to study allele patterns in quantitative trait loci (QTL)
    mapping over a chromosome.
    Useful in crosses with more than two alleles to identify how sets of alleles,
    genetically different strands at the same locus, have different response levels.
    Plots show profiles over a chromosome.
    Can handle multiple traits together.
